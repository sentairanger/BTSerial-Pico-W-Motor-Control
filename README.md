# BTSerial-Pico-W-Motor-Control
This project allows you to control a motor using the Serial Bluetooth App on Android and Picozero on the Pico W

## Getting Started

First, you need to upload the `picozero.py` file by going to this [link](https://github.com/RaspberryPiFoundation/picozero). Next, you will have to copy these files including the `picozero.py` file to your Pico W. This has been tested to work on the Pico W. However, this should work on the Pico W 2 as well. After that you can simply run the code from Thonny. Now if you want to run this without a monitory just rename the `motor_uart.py` file to `main.py`. Then install the SBT App on Android and make sure to define your Macros so you don't have to type the commands. Then pair with your Pico W and it should work.
